      <description>Basics of effective and reproducible data visualization As scientists, we are writers and artists. Images and figures are excellent and indispensable to share information and communicate our results. Depending on the audience (journals, social media, conference presentations, posters, etc.</description>

      <description>Beta diversity in space and time Variation in species composition across sites is known as beta diversity. This important dimension of biodiversity, which links local-scale (alpha) diversity to regional (gamma) diversity, is increasingly recognized as a key factor influencing metacommunity functioning and as an important target for conservation action.</description>

      <description>Introduction to GitHub and GitHub Actions Collaborations are rarely static: when people work on projects together, it is a continuously developing process of contributing ideas, giving and getting feedback, and addressing this feedback with changes until a goal is achieved.</description>

      <description>Joint Modelling Natural systems are complex and understanding them is a challenging task. In recent years, there has been an explosion in the amount of data that were gathered and made available that can potentially increase our knowledge of why and how species distribute as they do.</description>

      <title>Linking community ecology and evolutionary biology to your programming skills</title>
      <link>/symposium/r-symposium-11/</link>

      <description>Community Phylogenetics: linking community ecology and evolutionary biology to your programming skills How do species assemble in communities? What are the involved mechanisms? These questions have fascinated ecologists for decades. As the community assembly of organisms depends on historical and ecological phenomena, it is necessary to link evolutionary and ecological hypotheses testing to address these questions.</description>

      <description>Occupancy Modelling Site occupancy models are models that take into account the imperfect detection of organisms to determine the probability of presence of a species at a site. They can be considered as an extension of generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMM).</description>

      <title>Phylogenetic Comparative Methods in R</title>
      <link>/symposium/r-symposium-06/</link>

      <description>Phylogenetic Comparative Methods in R Theodosius Dobzhansky said in 1973 that “nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution”. Statistical comparative phylogenetic methods are one of the ways that allow us to understand historical patterns of life within an evolutionary context.</description>

      <guid>/symposium/r-symposium-07/</guid>
      <description>Survival analyses with R During this workshop, you will learn how to perform survival analyses with R. These models allow to study the time to an event of interest (e.g. death, first reproduction, observation of a behavior,…), and the factors that affect this time.</description>

      <title>Touchdown your research!</title>

      <description>Touchdown your research! Publication per peer-review process is made by and for scientists. It is also a slow and closed communication channel, limiting our ability to efficiently reach a broader audience within and outside academia.</description>
