**To cancel your registration before your workshop,** notify the lead presenter of the workshop (listed on the schedule on the <a href = "https://r.qcbs.ca/workshops/"> page of the workshop you are registered to</a> page) and carbon-copy (CC) your message to the QCBS Coordination team (csbq.qcbs.r@gmail.com).

**To request the partial reimbursement of your registration fees (see policies below)**, send an email to the QCBS institutional email (info@qcbs.ca), with Ms. Yella Jovich (QCBS administrative assistant, <yella.jovich@mcgill.ca>) and the QCBS Coordination team (csbq.qcbs.r@gmail.com) in CC.
 
### If you are a QCBS member

If you are a QCBS member and you cancel your participation at least 5 days before the workshop, there are no penalties. If you fail to attend a workshop or did not cancel your registration at least 5 days before the workshop date, you will be penalized for $50, which will be directly deducted from your principal investigatorâ€™s account.

### If a workshop is cancelled

The QCBS R Workshop Series coordinators will inform the participants and all registration fees will be reimbursed.
