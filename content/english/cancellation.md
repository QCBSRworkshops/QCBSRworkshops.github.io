## Cancelling your registration

All cancellations notices and refund requests must be received by e-mail **at least 5 days before the workshop date**. Exceptions can be made for unpredictable circumstances. 

**To cancel your registration,** notify the lead presenter of the workshop (listed on the <a href = "https://r.qcbs.ca/schedule/">schedule</a> page), and carbon-copy (CC) your message to Philippe Auzel (QCBS coordinator, <philippe.auzel@mcgill.ca>) and Helen Elina (QCBS administrative assistant, <helen.elina@mcgill.ca>).
 
### If you are a QCBS member

If you are a QCBS member and you cancel your participation at least 5 days before the workshop, there are no penalties. If you fail to attend a workshop or did not cancel your registration at least 5 days before the workshop date, you will be penalized for $50, which will be directly deducted from your principal investigatorâ€™s account.

### If you are not a QCBS member

If you are not a QCBS member and you cancel your participation at least 5 days before the workshop, you will receive 80% refund of your registration fee. If you fail to attend a workshop or did not cancel your registration at least 5 days before, your registration fee will not be refunded. Refunds are provided directly to the credit card used during the registration.

### If a workshop is cancelled

The QCBS R Workshop Series coordinators will inform the participants and all registration fees will be reimbursed.
