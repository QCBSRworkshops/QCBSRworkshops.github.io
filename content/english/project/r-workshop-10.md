## Workshop 10: Advanced multivariate analyses in `R`

In this workshop, you will learn how to perform advanced multivariate analyses on community data. 

This workshop concentrates on constrained methods such as redundancy analysis (RDA), multivariate regression tree (MRT) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to explore how environmental variables may be driving patterns in species assemblage across sites.
