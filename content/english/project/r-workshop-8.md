## Workshop 8: Generalized additive models in R

The goal of this workshop will be to first examine what is a non-linear model, and how Generalized Additive Models (GAM) allow us to handle non-linear relationships.

We will also go over how to plot and interpret these non-linear relationships, how to include interaction terms, autocorrelated errors and expand on previous workshop by briefly examining a mixed modeling framework. 

We will also briefly touch upon what GAM are doing behind the scenes.
