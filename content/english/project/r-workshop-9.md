## Workshop 9: Multivariate analyses in R

In this workshop, you will learn the basics of multivariate analyses that will allow you to reveal patterns in your community composition data.

You will first learn to choose appropriate distance metrics and transformations to then perform various multivariate analyses: clustering analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) and Non-Metric MultiDimensional Scaling (NMDS).
