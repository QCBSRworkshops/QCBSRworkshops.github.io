## Workshop 6: Generalized linear models in `R`

A significant limitation of linear models is that they cannot accommodate response variables that do not have a normal error distribution. Most biological data do not follow the assumption of normality. 

In this workshop, you will learn how to use generalized linear models, which are important tools to overcome the distributional assumptions of linear models. 

You will learn the major distributions used depending on the nature of the response variables, the concept of the link function, and how to verify assumptions of such models.
