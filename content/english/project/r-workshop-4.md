## Workshop 4: Linear models in `R`

In this workshop, you will learn how to implement in R basic linear models commonly used in ecology such as simple regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and multiple regression. After verifying visually and statistically the assumptions of these models and transforming your data when necessary, the interpretation of model outputs and the plotting of your final model will no longer keep secrets from you!
