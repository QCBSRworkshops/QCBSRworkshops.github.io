## Workshop 7: Linear and generalized linear mixed models (LMM and GLMM) in `R`

Mixed effects models allow ecologists to overcome a number of limitations associated with traditional linear models. 

In this workshop, you will learn when it is important to use a mixed effects model to analyze your data. 

We will walk you through the steps to conduct a linear mixed model analysis, check its assumptions, report results, and visually represent your model in R.
