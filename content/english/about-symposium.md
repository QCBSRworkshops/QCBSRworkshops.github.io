## Call for workshop proposals

The 4th QCBS R Workshop Series invites all QCBS-associated graduate students and post-doctorate fellows to submit proposals for workshops to be during the QCBS R Symposium. 

Workshops are expected to cover the concepts and the application of methods addressing relevant questions and content for graduate and post-doctoral scientists working in biodiversity research. We particularly encourage topics that are not covered by the regular QCBS R Workshop Series.

We encourage the involvement of scientists at different career levels, from different institutions, and geographical locations. We also note that we are mindful of the gender balance of presenters and participants and of the participation of under-represented groups within the QCBS R Workshop related activities. Participants are required to read and agree to our [Code of Conduct](https://r.qcbs.ca/code-of-conduct/).

Workshops can be created and presented in English or in French. The language in which the workshop will be presented will be announced in the R Symposium schedule.
