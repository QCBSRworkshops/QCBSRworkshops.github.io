## Workshop 5: Programming in `R`

This workshop focuses on basic programming in R. In this workshop, you will learn how to use control flow (`for` loops, `if`, `while`) methods to prevent code repetition, facilitate organization and run simulations. In addition, you will learn to write your own functions, and tips to program efficiently. The last part of the workshop will discuss packages that will not be covered elsewhere in this workshop series, but that may be of interest to participants.
