## Workshop 2: Loading and manipulating data in R

In this workshop, you will learn how to load, view, and manipulate your data in
R. You will learn basic commands to inspect and visualize your data, and learn
how to fix errors that may have occurred while loading your data into R. In
addition, you will learn how to write an R script, which is a text file that
contains your R commands and allows you to rerun your analyses in one simple
touch of a key (or maybe two, or three…)! We will then introduce `tidyr` and
`dplyr`, two powerful tools to manage and re-format your dataset, as well as
apply simple or complex functions on subsets of your data. This workshop will be
useful for those progressing through the entire workshop series, but also for
those who already have some experience in R and would like to become proficient
with new tools and packages.
