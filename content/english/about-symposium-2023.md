## Update

__We regret to inform you that the 5th edition of the QCBS R Symposium has been canceled due to the lack of workshop proposals.__ 

While we know this is disappointing, our first priority is always to organize and provide a structured platform for discussion and the exchange of ideas on the use of R in biodiversity science analyses.

We will give updates with a new possible date and location as soon as they are confirmed. 

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or if you would like to propose any workshop at csbq.qcbs.r@gmail.com.
