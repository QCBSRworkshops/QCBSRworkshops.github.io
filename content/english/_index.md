  - content: I am amazed by the high quality of the workshops, the presenters are very knowledgeable with the topics, and they are really good at teaching (i.e. using different ways to explain something). I also liked the discussion and advices based on the presenters' experiences.

  - content: C'était vraiment bien réussi! Je trouve que Maxime a très bien expliqué les concepts en mettant l'accent sur les notions les plus importantes. J'avais déjà suivi les instructions de l'atelier en ligne, mais le fait d'avoir une présentation en personne a beaucoup amélioré ma compréhension.
