  - content: The QCBS R Workshop Series was founded by QCBS students Vincent Fugère, Dalal Hanna, and Zofia Taranu in 2014, inspired by the [McGill BGSA stats workshops](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/). The 10 workshops that are still offered today were first developed by QCBS students and postdoctoral fellows, and have been developed by many other QCBS students and postdoctoral fellows since 2014. 
    name: Where we started
  - content: The QCBS R Workshop Series is a valuable resource for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows looking to improve their skills and gain experience in R, statistics, collaboration, and teaching, and in critically developing educational content. Almost every aspect of the series is made possible by contributions from students or post-doctoral fellows looking to develop their skills through coordinating the series, contributing to workshop development and instruction, and participating in the workshops year after year.
    name: Who we are
  - content: These open-access workshops were created by members of the QCBS both for members of the QCBS and the larger community. The content of these workshops has been continuously peer-reviewed and developed by QCBS members since their initial development in 2014. The workshop series is instructed by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows of the QCBS in English and in French every year.
