    The QCBS R Workshop Series is graduate student and post-doctoral fellow initiative from the Québec Centre for Biodiversity Science. We organize, develop and instruct R workshops in English and in French to other graduate students and early-career researchers every year to help them navigate statistics for research in ecology, evolution and biodiversity science.

  - content: The QCBS R Workshop Series was founded by QCBS student and post-doctoral fellows Vincent Fugère, Dalal Hanna, and Zofia Taranu in 2014, inspired by the [McGill BGSA stats workshops](https://sites.google.com/site/mcgillbgsa/). All workshops offered today were first developed by QCBS students and postdoctoral fellows, and have been maintained by many other QCBS students and postdoctoral fellows since 2014. In 2017, Léa Blondel, Marie-Hélène Brice and Pedro Henrique P. Braga began a process to improve the reproducibility and collaboration of the workshop material by converting the original Prezi presentations into RMarkdown code, and transitioning to hosting and developing content on GitHub. The current coordination team has continued with this task and will soon have completed the conversion of the written material to RMarkdown and the centralization of all workshops in Github.
    name: Where we started
  - content: The QCBS R Workshop Series is a valuable resource for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows looking to improve their skills and gain experience in R, statistics, collaboration, and teaching, and in critically developing educational content. Almost every aspect of the series is made possible by contributions from students or post-doctoral fellows looking to develop their skills through coordinating the series, contributing to workshop development and instruction, and participating in the workshops year after year.
    name: What we do
  - content: These open-access workshops were created by members of the QCBS both for members of the QCBS and the larger community. The content of these workshops has been continuously peer-reviewed and developed by QCBS members since their initial development in 2014. The workshop series is instructed by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows of the QCBS in English and in French every year.
    name: How we work
  - content: QCBS students coordinate the R Workshop Series and the annual R Symposium. The series is currently coordinated by four QCBS students - Pedro Henrique P. Braga (2017-current), Katherine Hébert (2020-current), Linley Sherin (2020-current), and Esteban Gongora (2020-current). Past coordinators include Marc-Olivier Beausoleil (2018-2019), Léa Blondel (2017-2018), Marie-Hélène Brice (2017-2020), Alexis Carteron (2019-2020), Vincent Fugère (2014-2017), Dalal Hanna (2014-2017), Krista Oke (2016-2017), Jacob Ziegler (2015-2016), Zofia Taranu (2014-2016).
