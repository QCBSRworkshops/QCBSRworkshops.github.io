## About the workshops

**Do I need to know R before coming to a workshop?**

**What can I expect from these workshops?**

The R Workshop Series strives to give participants the statistical, programming, and R tools necessary to carry out analyses in R that are commonly used in ecology, evolutionary biology, and biodiversity science. The workshops primarily aim to give enough theoretical and statistical background information to understand when and how to apply the methods that are covered in each workshop, how to implement them in R, and to be able to interpret their outputs. However, it is not possible to cover each of the 10 topics in great detail within a typical workshop session. These workshops are therefore *not* intended to replace a formal training in statistics that is needed to understand and apply the selected methods in depth. They will, however, supply some of the vocabulary and useful building blocks in R which can be explored further in the context of your research or work.

In terms of structure, workshops typically run for three hours, separated into two hour-and-a-half sections separated by a longer break of one hour. Workshop instructors will generally follow the same structure as the slides, answering questions along the way, with the option to show additional materials if they wish. We encourage participants to comment the supplied script as they follow the workshop, or to write the presented code in a blank script as they follow along, according to the learning style that best suits the participant. Each workshop contains several "challenges", which are designed to enable the participants to practice the tools and concepts that are presented during the workshop. These are typically done in breakout room groups, and the solutions are discussed with the larger group. 

**I can't make it to a workshop I'm interested in. Are the workshops recorded?**

The R Workshops are not recorded. However, the slides, script, and books that accompany each workshop are open and free to access in both English and French. You can find links to the materials of each workshop by accessing the <a href = "https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/project/">workshops page</a>, or by navigating to the workshop's repository on our <a href = "https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops">GitHub</a>.
