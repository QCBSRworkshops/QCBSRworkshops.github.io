## About the workshops

**Do I need to know `R` before coming to a workshop?**

It depends! The workshop series includes very basic workshops that offer a comprehensive introduction to `R`, but also more advanced ones that will require some basic knowledge in `R`. We recommend that you participate in (or get comfortable with the content of) the first two workshops (*WK-01: Introduction to `R`* and *WK-02: Loading and manipulating data in `R`*) before coming to the more advanced workshops.

**What can I expect from these workshops?**

The `R` Workshop Series strives to give participants the statistical, programming, and tools necessary to carry out analyses in R that are commonly used in ecology, evolutionary biology, and biodiversity science. The workshops primarily aim to give enough theoretical and statistical background information to understand when and how to apply the methods that are covered in each workshop, how to implement them in R, and to be able to interpret their outputs. However, it is not possible to cover each of the 10 topics in great detail within a typical workshop session. These workshops are therefore *not* intended to replace a formal training in statistics that is needed to understand and apply the selected methods in depth. They will, however, supply some of the vocabulary and useful building blocks in R which can be explored further in the context of your research or work.

In terms of structure, workshops typically run for three hours, split into two hour-and-a-half sections separated by a longer break of one hour. Workshop instructors will generally follow the same structure as the slides, answering questions along the way, with the option to show additional materials if they wish. We encourage participants to comment the supplied script as they follow the workshop, or to write the presented code in a blank script as they follow along, according to the learning style that best suits the participant. Each workshop contains several "challenges", which are designed to enable the participants to practice the tools and concepts that are presented during the workshop. These are typically done in breakout room groups, and the solutions are discussed with the larger group. 

**I can't make it to a workshop I'm interested in. Are the workshops recorded?**

The R Workshops are not recorded. However, the slides, script, and books that accompany each workshop are open and free to access in both English and French. You can find links to the materials of each workshop by accessing the <a href = "https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/workshops/">workshops page</a>, or by navigating to the workshop's repository on our <a href = "https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops">GitHub</a>.

**I registered for a workshop, but did not receive a link for the Zoom meeting. How can I access the workshop?**

You will receive a link for the Zoom meeting within the week for the workshop. Make sure to look into the Spam folder of your email provider. If you have not received a link before three days prior to your workshop, send a message to the presenter responsible for the workshop you are attending.  


## Cancellation

**I registered for a workshop, but can no longer attend. What should I do?**

All cancellations notices and refund requests must be received by e-mail **at least 5 days before the workshop date**. Exceptions can be made for unpredictable circumstances. **To cancel your registration,** notify the lead presenter of the workshop (listed on the schedule on the <a href = "https://wiki.qcbs.ca/r">wiki</a> page), and carbon-copy (CC) your message to Philippe Auzel (QCBS coordinator, <philippe.auzel@mcgill.ca>) and Helen Elina (QCBS administrative assistant, <helen.elina@mcgill.ca>).
 
**If you are a QCBS member:**

If you cancel your participation at least 5 days before the workshop, there are no penalties. If you fail to attend a workshop or did not cancel your registration at least 5 days before the workshop date, you will be penalized for $50, which will be directly deducted from your principal investigatorâ€™s account.

**If you are not a QCBS member:**

If you cancel your participation at least 5 days before the workshop, you will receive 80% refund of your registration fee. If you fail to attend a workshop or did not cancel your registration at least 5 days before, your registration fee will not be refunded. Refunds are provided directly to the credit card used during the registration.

**If a workshop is cancelled**, the organizers will inform the participants and all registration fees will be reimbursed.


## Feedback & Contributions

**How can I give feedback about a workshop I attended?**

There are several ways of giving feedback about a workshop you attended! We use this feedback to improve the workshops every year, so we greatly encourage you to provide feedback. 

First, the lead instructor of the workshop will send a follow-up email about the workshop containing a link to a survey requesting your feedback. If you do not have this link, feel free to contact the lead presenter for the link. 

If you have specific feedback about the presentation slides or the book content such as mistakes or inconsistencies, or if you would like to make any other suggestions about the workshop form or content, you are invited to [open an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) on the [GitHub](https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops) repository for the workshop in question. If you do not have a GitHub account, or are not comfortable with GitHub, please [contact](https://qcbsrworkshops.github.io/contact/) the workshop coordinators directly with your feedback.
