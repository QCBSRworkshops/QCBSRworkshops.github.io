## Survival analyses with R

During this workshop, you will learn how to perform survival analyses with R. These models allow to study the time to an event of interest (e.g. death, first reproduction, observation of a behavior,…), and the factors that affect this time. First, you will learn how to organize and format your data. Then, we will go through the different steps of survival analyses: non-parametric estimation of the survival function, Cox’s models and parametric models. For each step, you will learn how to interpret and to illustrate the results.
