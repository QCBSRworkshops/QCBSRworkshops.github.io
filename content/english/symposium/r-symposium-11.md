## Community Phylogenetics: linking community ecology and evolutionary biology to your programming skills

How do species assemble in communities? What are the involved mechanisms? These questions have fascinated ecologists for decades. As the community assembly of organisms depends on historical and ecological phenomena, it is necessary to link evolutionary and ecological hypotheses testing to address these questions. By combining phylogenetic information and species geographical co-existence, ‘community phylogenetics’ emerged as field seeking to reveal patterns and processes driving the organization and structure of ecological communities. In this workshop, we will dive into the debates and controversies surrounding the community structure and learn some of the various approaches used by community phylogenetics to detect evolutionary patterns on community assembly.
