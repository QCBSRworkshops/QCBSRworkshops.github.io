## The Bayesian Biologist: You are probably more Bayesian than you think

Jump with us into the world of probabilities with a workshop on Bayesian inference. We are going to explore this statistical framework with simple and meaningful examples for biologists. We plan to guide you through some theory, history, applications, and get your hands dirty with some code. At the end of the workshop, youâ€™ll be convinced that Bayesian statistics are a super powerful framework to interpret the world, and get a taste of the ways you might implement them in your own research.
