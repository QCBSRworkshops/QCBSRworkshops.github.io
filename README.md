Organised by students, for the whole community, this series of 10 workshops walks participants through the steps required to use R for a wide array of statistical analyses relevant to research in biology and ecology. These open-access workshops were created and are continuously developed by members of the [Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science (QCBS)](https://qcbs.ca/). This website presents the Series, its contents, and the students that contribute to this initiative.
