Organised by students, for the whole community, this series of 10 workshops walks participants through the steps required to use R for a wide array of statistical analyses relevant to research in biology and ecology. These open-access workshops were created and are continuously developed by members of the [Quebec Centre for Biodiversity Science (QCBS)](https://qcbs.ca/). This website presents the Series, its contents, and the students that contribute to this initiative.

To add images or data that can be referenced and used in the website, place files in `static/images` or `static/data`.

To edit the layout of a given page or section, edit the .html file in `themes/airspace-hugo/layouts/` that is referenced as the layout in the YAML header of the .md file containing the page content. You can also make your own html layout for a new page, as we did for the R Symposium and the Workshop pages.

## Building the website

1. Set your working directory to the website repository folder, or simply open the R project `website.Rproj`.

2. To serve the site locally in order to preview your changes, run `blogdown::serve_site()`.

3. To build the site locally, run `blogdown::build_site()`. You must build the site before pushing any changes to this repository in order to ensure it is still buildable.

4. To build the website through GitHub Pages, see the development workflow details below. 


## Development workflow 

The website is built and deployed with the following GitHub Actions workflow: [`blogdown.yaml`](https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops/QCBSRworkshops.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/blogdown.yaml). This workflow pauses if the repository is not edited for more than 19 days. If new changes are not showing on the website, try checking that this workflow is still enabled, and commit a small change to `main/` in order to trigger it.
